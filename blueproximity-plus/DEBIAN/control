Description: automatic screenlocking depending on bluetooth dev proximity
 Leave your PC - it is locked automatically, come back and it is back too...
 This software helps you add a little more security to your desktop. It does
 so by detecting one of your bluetooth devices, most likely your mobile
 phone, and keeping track of its distance. If you move away from your
 computer and the distance is above a certain level (no measurement in
 meters is possible) for a given time, it automatically locks your desktop
 (or starts any other shell command you want).
 .
 Once away your computer awaits its master back - if you are nearer than a
 given level for a set time your computer unlocks magically without any
 interaction (or starts any other shell command you want).
